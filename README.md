# csci1070_final_project
final project for CSCI 1070 Fall semester 2024

techniques used: Random Forest Classifier, KNN, SVM

All three models used had accuracy of slightly above 50%, which suggests that the datasets features have some limitations

Role 0 (controller) and role 3 (duelist) were the most accurately classified, while roles 2 and 4 (initiator, sentinel) were high in misclassifications, which is likely due to their overlapping playstyles resulting in less distinct patterns in the data
